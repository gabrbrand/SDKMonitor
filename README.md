**SDK Monitor** shows you which Android API levels your installed apps are targeting. Since 2017 Google requires apps to target recent API levels for better security and privacy, this tool helps you see how up-to-date your apps really are.

## Why does this matter?

Newer Android versions come with better security and privacy features. When apps target recent API levels, they're forced to use these improvements. But Android doesn't show you this information by default, so SDK Monitor makes it visible. It also helps you see which apps are updating because they have to, versus those that genuinely want to improve.

## üìä About SDK versions

Here's what different API levels mean:

- **API 34** (Android 14): Partial photo/video access
- **API 33** (Android 13): Themed app icons, per-app language preferences, notification permission
- **API 32** (Android 12L): Improved large screen support, new splash screen API
- **API 31** (Android 12): Material You, approximate location permission, clipboard access notifications
- **API 30** (Android 11): Scoped storage enforcement, one-time permissions, background location restrictions
- **API 29** (Android 10): Scoped storage (optional), dark theme, gesture navigation
- **API 28** (Android 9): Network security config required, Apache HTTP client removed
- **API 26-27** (Android 8.x): Background execution limits, notification channels, adaptive icons
- **API 24-25** (Android 7.x): File provider requirements, doze mode, multi-window support
- **Below API 24**: Missing modern security and privacy features

Higher API levels mean apps must adopt newer security and privacy protections.
